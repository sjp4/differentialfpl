# Differential FPL

See http://differentialfpl.blogspot.com/ for what it does. It does quite a lot!

I no time to maintain this now (and Google removed it from the play store for extremely tenous gambling rule violations), so here is Differential FPL in all of its (outdated, messy) glory.

### Notes

* You don't be able to compile and run this for the new season without modification; each year it needs a number of manual update steps (updating the database file with the new season, adding new team ids/names, fixing any login/scoring issues, adding assets for teams/players with sthe correct IDs, many more things which I've forgotten right now). If you attempt to do this, ping me @stevepenna and I'll try to help you out, at least with last year's diff
* This is old code. It was my first Android project. Yes, I'm ashamed of most of it - but its works :) It's still an eclipse project, so there's also that. I won't go into all of the ways that this code is bad.
* I'm not accepting pull requesting and/or maintaining the project. Fork away!
